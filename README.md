Parity checking, which was created to eliminate data communication errors, is a simple method of network data verification and has an easy and understandable working mechanism.

As an example, if the original data is 1010001, there are three 1s. When even parity checking is used, a parity bit with value 1 is added to the dataâ€™s left side to make the number of 1s even; transmitted data becomes 11010001. However, if odd parity checking is used, then parity bit value is zero; 01010001
